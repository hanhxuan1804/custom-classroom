## Application Flow

The client-side application appears to be a React application utilizing Redux for state management. It follows a component-based architecture, with components organized into different directories based on their functionality. The "pages" directory contains React components representing different pages of the application, while the "component" directory contains reusable components used throughout the application.

The server-side application appears to be a Node.js application using Express.js as the web framework. It follows a component-based architecture, with components organized into different directories based on their functionality. The "component" directory contains components related to different features of the application, such as authentication, groups, group posts, presentations, and users. The "mongooseModel" directory contains Mongoose models representing database entities.

The client-side application communicates with the server-side application through API calls defined in the "api.js" file. The server-side application handles these API requests using the defined routes in the server-side components.

Overall, the folder structure follows a modular and organized approach, separating concerns- .$hellroom.drawio.bkp
